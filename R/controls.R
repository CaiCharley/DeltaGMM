#' Parameters used to control imputation of chromatograms
#'
#' @param imputation Type of imputation to use for missing values.
#'  * `"dynamic"` (the default): Imputes NAs as 0, then dynamically sets the
#'  weight based on the distance to the nearest quantified fraction with
#'  [distance_from_quantified()]. Weights are passed to [nls()].
#'
#'  * `"weights"`: Used with `na_weights` argument. Sets all missing values to 0
#'  and sets a fixed weight based on `na_weights`.
#'
#'  * `"fill_gaps"`: Used with `max_dist` argument. Sets missing values that are
#'  greater or equal to`max_dist` from the nearest quantified fraction to 0 and
#'  leaves closer missing values as NA. This was the first method of imputation
#'  developed to make sure nls doesn't fit gaussians to large gaps without
#'  penalization.
#'
#'  * `"none"`: No imputation and raw values are passed to [nls()].
#' @param max_dist Maximum gap of unquantified fractions before imputation
#' @param na_weight The weight of missing values imputed as 0
#' @param log_k,log_x The `k` and `x_0` value of the logistic function used in
#'  dynamic imputation of weights. `k` represents the value of the sigmoid
#'  midpoint or how many fractions away from the nearest quantified fraction
#'  for the imputed weights to be 0.5. `k` is the steepness of curve transition
#'  from 0 to 1. Default of 1.5 and 4 were determined emperically.
#'
#' @return An named list of class `imputectrl` with specified parameters

#' Parameters used to control GMM fitting
#'
#' @param max_gaussians The maximum number of Gaussians to fit. Defaults to 5.
#' @param criterion_fn function used in model selection.
#'  Choose one of [AICc()] (default), [AIC()], [BIC()].
#' @param max_iterations The number of times to try fitting the curve with
#' different initial conditions.
#' @param init_method The method used to select the initial conditions for
#'  nonlinear least squares optimization. One of `"guess"` (default) or `
#'  "random"`.
#' @param height_min Ratio to the max value within the chromatograms for which
#'  gaussians with lower heights will be filtered out. Defaults to 0.15.
#' @param height_max Ratio to the max value within the chromatograms for
#'  which gaussians with larger heights will be filtered out. Defaults to 1.5.
#' @param variance_min Minimum variance for fitted gaussians. Defaults to 1.
#' @param variance_max Maximum variance for fitted gaussians. `0` sets maximum
#'  variance to half the fractions (default).
#' @param rssweights Calculate RSS with imputed values adjusted by their weight.
#' @param return_fit Returns the fitted model from [nls()]. Useful for
#' exporatory analysis. Defaults to `FALSE`.
